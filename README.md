## What is NAV-AR ?
###### NAV-AR is a mobile application that delivers highly accurate indoor mapping and navigation using Augmented Reality built on the principles of SLAM.
###### navigation using Augmented Reality built on the principles of SLAM.

## Inspiration 
###### In this age almost every inch of our world is already mapped. You’ll navigate using google maps or some other GPS app.,
######  However, once you reach your destination and go indoors, GPS has no line of sight and you go back for asking directions
######  this is where NAV-AR “comes into play”(enters).


## How We built it
###### We built navAR by use of SLAM i.e., Simultaneous Localization and Mapping,  a computational technique that involves
###### the task of constructing an internal map of an unknown area whilst keeping track of its position inside the area. 
###### Next we rendered the map and made use of A* pathfinding algorithm for finding shortest path. To deliver a highly 
###### interactive  Augmented Reality Experience, we used Unity Engine and Google ARCore. Lastly we made use of a QR code 
###### scan mechanism for calibration and localisation purposes.
###### Our Team built EduLabs using  :
<ul>
  <li> <b>Unity</b> </li>
  <li> <b>Google ARCore </b> </li>
  <li> <b>SLAM</b></li>
  <li> <b>C# </b></li>
  <li> <b>A* Pathfinding algo</b></li>
</ul>

## Challenges We ran into
###### (re)positioning the user inside the map while navigation 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
###### Creating a fully functional Augmented Reality app(prototype) in a short span of time

## What I learned
###### Implementing Augmented Reality,A* algo for wayfinding, Baking nav mesh and had a great experience.

## What's next for "NAV-AR"
###### Making it more cloud dependent so that the user can download the map from the database to navigate.
